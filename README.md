# Espresso App
An academic project for Human Computer Interaction course.

## Description
In this project we tried to make a new updated interface of a typical non-smart home espresso machine. We added new functions, which current one does not have. Moreover, this application addressed the visually impaired people, with voice assistant.
Below, you can see each fragment how it looks like, in the final version.

##Fragments
First install you can observe this box where "Voice Commands is writen on. If the user press this button, automatically Voice Assistant will be enabled.
